### To-Do List/Plans 
##### (No particular order of priority)
1) Client Install - User will be able to install the P4 Helix Visual client via this tool, and be taken through the fields needed to create the p4config file, as outlined [here](https://asm-demo.assembla.com/spaces/cs-perforce-test/perforce-7/instructions). This should be the first feature.

2) Perforce Instance Monitoring - Transcribe [locks.pl](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/files/guest/dan_bloch/locks.pl) written by Dan Bloch, into Python and implement as module. This would be a very helpful function of the tool. 

3) Add Migration Functionality- Using a trusted SSH Connection to `scp` filed and run said migration.

4) Add Debug Dump- users would be able to review logs

5) Investigate the potential for a "Switch depot" feature (Suggested by Toshi D.).

6) Add functionality that allows users to point to files at URLs where they can go pull down the checkpoint/logs. 

7) $PATH verification
More to come...
